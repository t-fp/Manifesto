      <h1>Prelude to Future Party</h1>
      <h2>The Manifesto</h2>

      <p>We, a collective of people from Sri Lankan roots spread around the globe, are determined to work towards the betterment of Sri Lanka, facilitating and actively participating to build platforms, and infrastructure to transform Sri Lanka into a modern, democratic and progressive state from its current form.</p>

      <p>We are inspired by the #SriLankaUprising in 2022 of the great demonstration of resilience, collective actions, and empathic intervention of the people of Sri Lanka in a wake of an unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis.</p>

      <p>We are <em>activists</em>. We believe resistance is the key to the progress of civilization, and activism is the spirit of society that maintains the balance of political power against all the feudalistic, corrupted, and authoritarian political establishments and tyranny.</p>

      <p>We are <em>futurists</em>. We believe collective actions in the long term and futuristic perspective for the betterment of society are the only things that keep humanity at bay from destruction.</p>

      <p>We are <em>techrealists</em>. We understand that technology has become inseparable from human existence, and the internet is revolutionizing every aspect of society at a rate that no one ever imagined. We also believe that technology isn’t neutral, and activism in the electronic frontier is also essential for progress.</p>

      <p>We are <em>Internationalists</em>. We believe in humanity as a whole, and all of the geographical, political, racial, or class boundaries are mere illusions on the grand scale.</p>

      <p>We are <em>environmentalists</em>. We believe as a fact that environmental disasters are the most threatening danger to humanity. We acknowledge that we are in and heading to a Climate Emergency and Climate Actions must have utmost importance in progressive politics and activism in this age.</p>

      <p>Above all, we are <em>humans</em>, though we are activists who have strong ties to Sri Lanka which is a beautiful island nation in Asia, we always believe humanity is the primary and most true connection we have in this world.</p>

      <p>We, all of us that band together behind this manifesto are individuals who believe in a progressive society, against all forms of discrimination and oppression; we pledge to stand against all kinds of feudalistic, oppressive, and authoritarian political establishments, stand with every justified people’s struggles around the world, in every way we can.</p>

      <p>We first gathered as a collective, in the direst time of Sri Lanka, believing and hoping that we can contribute to making a difference in the Sri Lankan people’s struggle and on the way forward. On this day, we pledge that we are marching together until those dreams are achieved and beyond.</p>

      <p>Let’s join the voyage!</p>

      <p><em>September, 2022</em></p>
